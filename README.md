# Homework 2 Programming II Task

In this homework, we manage binary and text files in Java.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders, where:

- `src` : The folder to maintain sources.
- `lib` : The folder to maintain dependencies.
- `data` : The folder to store the necessary archives
- `icons` : The folder that contains the icons that will be show on JOptionPane's dialogs
- `resources` : The folder that shows the output data for the third point
- `model` : This package contains necessary classes for the proyect 
- `presenter` : This package contains the runnable classes for each point of the homework and classes named Constants, those classes contains messages that are used in the proyect
- `tools` : This package contains the necessary classes that are used for managing binary and text files
- `view` : This package contains classes that are used to show menus and inputs that users will need to register data

## First Point

To run the content of the first point, follow the steps below.  
1. Open `src` folder.
2. Open `presenter` package.
3. Open `FirstPoint.java` and run it.

The text to work with is located in folder `data` -> `input` and its named `firstPoint.java` .

## Second Point

** IMPORTANT **   
For convient reasons, users need to write the requested path using the simple slash "/", in order to secure the right funtionality of the app. But, users can use the backslash "\\" and the app will run anyways but the probabilities of getting bugs or errors are higger.
  
  To run the content of the second point, follow the steps below.  
1. Open `src` folder.
2. Open `presenter` package.
3. Open `SecondPoint.java` and run it.
  
  To verify the results, just go to the resource path that you type. In that path, the file will be created with all the requested things.

## Third Point

  To run the content of the third point, follow the steps below.  
1. Open `src` folder.
2. Open `presenter` package.
3. Open `ThirdPoint.java` and run it.
  
  To verify the results, open `resources` folder, the new files should be created.

** IMPORTANT **   
If you want to check the other menu options, after you complete the register of a vehicle, go to the folder `resources`, then right click on the folder name and click refresh.  
 Once you've done this, you can either run the program again or go back to the window and explore the other options the menu has.
